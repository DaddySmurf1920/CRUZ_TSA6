                <h3>Bruce Wayne</h3>
                <p>Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, is Gotham City's dark knight. By day, he is a wealthy philanthropist and CEO of Wayne Enterprises. By night, he dons the cape and cowl to protect Gotham from its many villains. Trained to the peak of human physical and mental perfection, Batman relies on his detective skills, martial arts prowess, and an array of high-tech gadgets. His commitment to justice is driven by the traumatic loss of his parents, making him one of the most relentless and feared crime-fighters in the DC Universe.</p>

                <h2>Nightwing</h2>
                <h3>Dick Grayson</h3>
                <p>Dick Grayson was the first Robin, taken under Batman’s wing after the tragic death of his circus performer parents. As Robin, he fought alongside Batman against Gotham's criminals, but eventually, he sought his own path. Dick adopted the identity of Nightwing and moved to the neighboring city of Blüdhaven, where he operates as its protector. Nightwing is known for his acrobatic prowess, inherited from his circus days, and his leadership skills, often leading superhero teams like the Teen Titans. His dedication and optimism make him a beacon of hope in contrast to Batman’s dark persona.</p>

                <h2>Red Hood</h2>
                <h3>Jason Todd</h3>
                <p>Jason Todd was the second Robin, chosen by Batman after being found trying to steal the Batmobile’s tires. Jason’s tenure as Robin was marked by his aggressive and rebellious nature. His life took a tragic turn when he was brutally murdered by the Joker. Jason was later resurrected via the Lazarus Pit, returning with a darker, more violent approach to justice. As the Red Hood, he often clashes with Batman over their differing methods. Jason's Red Hood persona combines his combat skills with a willingness to use lethal force, positioning him as an anti-hero with a personal vendetta against crime and corruption.</p>

                <h2>Robin</h2>
                <h3>Tim Drake</h3>
                <p>Tim Drake, the third Robin, is unique for having deduced Batman and Nightwing’s identities on his own. Driven by a strong sense of justice and keen intellect, Tim approached Bruce Wayne to take up the mantle of Robin after Jason Todd’s death. Tim’s tenure as Robin is marked by his detective skills and technological prowess, making him a formidable sidekick and later a hero in his own right. Tim’s methodical and strategic approach to crime-fighting complements Batman’s own, and he has proven himself to be one of the most capable and reliable members of the Bat-family.</p>

                <h2>Scarecrow</h2>
                <h3>Jonathan Crane</h3>
                <p>Scarecrow, real name Jonathan Crane, is a former psychologist and professor who turned to crime using fear as his weapon. Specializing in phobias and the nature of fear, Crane developed a fear toxin that induces terrifying hallucinations in his victims. His criminal activities are often driven by a desire to prove his theories on fear, making him one of Batman’s most psychologically complex adversaries. Scarecrow’s mastery of fear tactics and his deep understanding of human psychology make him a formidable foe who can manipulate and terrorize Gotham’s citizens and its heroes alike.</p>
